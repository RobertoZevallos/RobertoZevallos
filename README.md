- 👋 Hi, I’m Roberto Zevallos.
- 💡 I’m interested in managing data to drive better business decisions.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I’ve never seen a process which I didn’t want to try to improve. I’m always searching for a better way.
- 🐍 I’m currently studying a master's in Business Analytics, developing knowledge in data science, machine learning supervised and unsupervised algorithms, statistical modeling and improving my data visualization skills.
- 👍 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve data management for business decisions and process improvements.
- :soccer: :runner: :family: I love to watch soccer, exercise in the morning, and spend time with my family to recharge.
